# speech-recognition-system

This is about implementing a signal analysis and speech recognition system using MATLAB.

Features including:

-- audio signal plotting\
-- speech start and end points detection\
-- Discrete Fourier Transformation\
-- signal pre-emphasize\
-- signal compression(Linear predictve coding)\
-- feature extraction(MFCC)\
-- speech recognition using distortion matrix and dynamic programming
